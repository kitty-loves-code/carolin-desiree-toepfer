## Profile

Dipl.sc.pol.Univ. and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) with hands-on and strategic experience supporting organizations from 10 to 1,000+ employees across finance, technology, and high-growth environments. My work focuses on building business-aligned, resilient security structures that are operational, measurable, and adopted across organizations.

I combine cybersecurity, governance, fraud prevention, AI risk, organizational design, and executive communication to translate security into real business value: reduced risk, regulatory readiness, protected reputation, and scalable growth.

I am also responsible for security-by-design, platform architecture, and product development at Cyttraction®, a next-generation risk prevention and learning platform with integrated habit and attention management.

I work globally as a keynote speaker on cybersecurity leadership, AI risk, digital trust, and security as a business enabler, addressing executive audiences, technology teams, and international conferences.
